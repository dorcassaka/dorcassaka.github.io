            <p>
            Here are some of the places that I enjoyed desserts from in 2019!
            </p>

            <p>
            This dedicant red velvet Easter cake from Some Crust in Claremont, CA was incredible! 
            </p>

            <p>
            There's a reason why Disney is where the magic happens... this mint chocolate chip icecream in a waffle cone from Disneyland: California Adventures was sure magically.
            </p>

            <p>
            Enjoy a few scoops of vanilla icream from Margie's - one of the oldest icream paroles in Chicago!
            </p>

            <p>
            Donuts and icecream (and some fudge!) sign me up! Firecakes is a must on your next trip to Chicago!
            </p>

            <p>
             Looking to catch up with some friends or a new date night spot? Spot Dessert Bar in New York city is the perfect spot :) You'll fall in love with the creamy icrecream and the buttery pastry.
            </p>

            <p>
            Sloan's has too many flavors to count, but when grab a scoop before watching the sunset in Santa Monica, California. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Though not *techinically* a dessert, boba tea from Boba Guys in Palo Alto is too astecially pleasing not to get. 
            </p>
